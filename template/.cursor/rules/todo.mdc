- have a look at docs/todos.md
- before you proceed to the next TODO, make sure, ./check.sh is running.
- before you proceed to the next TODO, make sure, you do a review: Clear, separated, understandable code?
- find the next open todo
- check, if it makes sense to do it or if
  - it needs to be refined first with SUB-TODOS
  - some other todo is - from an implementation point of view - better suited
- tell the user what you are going to do and do it.
