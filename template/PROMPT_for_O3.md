PUT YOUR IDEA HERE

----
From all you learned above, create three documents with detailed instructions for an ai on how to implement the bot:


**design.md** (WHAT, from a users and product-owners and buyers perspective): 
- purpose and general vision of the system (eg intuitive CRM for small teams)
- important concepts from the users perspective (eg no forms, just dialogs)
- use-cases: well everything a user wants to do... case for case
- components, layers and decoupling of the system
- users view to domain-entities/objects and their relationship
- general interaction structure of the system in terms of pages, tabs, sections, menues 
- style of ui: e.g. with examples links or verbal descriptions or pictures
understandable for human and ai)

**requirements.md** (HOW, from a implements perspective: tech stack, inner working and technical realisation, e.g. a menu as sliding side bar, a complete data model)
Based on design.
    
**todos.md** (STEP BY STEP, sequence of things that are to be done, to get design and requirements implemented)
- [ ] a todo
   - [ ] a sub-todo
